Okay, let's figure out why the profile picture isn't updating on the home page.

Based on the code, particularly the ModernUserWelcome component, here's the most likely explanation:   

Image Path: The component tries to load the image using the path <img src="/belford-avatar.png" ... />. This path tells the browser to look for the image directly at the root of your website (e.g., your-app-url.com/belford-avatar.png).   
File Location Expectation: In a Vite project structure like yours, files served directly from the root path (/) usually need to reside in the public directory within your client's root folder. Given your configuration, this would likely be client/public/.    
onError Hides the Problem: The ModernUserWelcome component has an onError handler attached to the image tag. If the browser fails to load the image at /belford-avatar.png (likely because it's not in the client/public directory and therefore doesn't exist at that URL), this error handler runs and hides the image element (target.style.display = 'none';). This prevents a broken image icon but makes it seem like the image simply isn't being rendered.   
Deployment Logs: Seeing calls in the deployment logs might just be the browser attempting to fetch /belford-avatar.png. If these requests are resulting in a 404 (Not Found) error, it confirms the file isn't being served from the expected location.
How to Fix:

Check File Location: Verify where you have placed the belford-avatar.png file within your project structure.
Move the File: Ensure that belford-avatar.png is located inside the client/public directory. If it's somewhere else (like client/src/assets), move it to client/public/.
Rebuild & Redeploy: After confirming the file is in client/public/, you'll need to rebuild your client application (npm run build) and redeploy it. This ensures the image file is copied correctly into the final dist/public directory  that gets served to users.   
Once the image is in the correct public directory and the application is redeployed, the path /belford-avatar.png should work, the onError handler won't trigger, and the image should display correctly in the ModernUserWelcome component.
