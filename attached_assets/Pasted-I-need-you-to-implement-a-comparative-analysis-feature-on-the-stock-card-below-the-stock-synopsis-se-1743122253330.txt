I need you to implement a comparative analysis feature on the stock card below the stock synopsis section. Here are the instructions. please let me know if you have any comments/instructions/feedback/points to clarify before we implement this. You MUST be careful about creating too many uncessary files, making these edits/implementation in files that have nothing to do with this 

The comparative analysis section will provide users with visual tools to compare the current stock with similar companies, enhancing educational value and decision-making capabilities. This feature will include two visualization options: a radar/spider chart and a quadrant comparison.These two options are togglable to switch. 

1. Radar Chart Implementation
Purpose
To visually display how the current stock compares to 4 random companies in the same industry across multiple metrics simultaneously.
Data Structure

Use existing portfolio impact calculator weighted scores
Display 5 stocks total (current stock + 4 comparisons)
Metrics to display (4 key metrics):

Performance
Stability
Value
Momentum
Dividend yield (if applicable)




Visual Design

Use distinct colors for each company
Make current stock's line more prominent (thicker, brighter color)
Include a legend identifying each company
Add tooltips showing exact values when hovering

Interaction

Allow users to tap on company names in the legend to toggle visibility
Include brief explanation text about radar charts for educational purposes

2. Quadrant Comparison Implementation
Purpose
To position stocks relative to each other based on two key metrics, helping users understand trade-offs between different investment qualities.
Recommended Quadrant Metrics
For maximum educational value and digestibility, I recommend these quadrant options:
Option 1: Risk vs. Return Quadrant

X-axis: Volatility/Risk (low to high)
Y-axis: Expected Return (low to high)
Quadrants interpretation:

Top Left: Low risk, high return (ideal)
Top Right: High risk, high return (performance stocks)
Bottom Left: Low risk, low return (stable stocks)
Bottom Right: High risk, low return (avoid)



Option 2: Value vs. Performance Quadrant

X-axis: Value score (low to high)
Y-axis: Performance potential (low to high)
Quadrants interpretation:

Top Left: Low value, high performance (performance stocks)
Top Right: High value, high performance (ideal stocks)
Bottom Left: Low value, low performance (avoid)
Bottom Right: High value, low performance (value stocks)



Visual Design

Use a simple scatter plot with quadrant lines
Make current stock point larger/highlighted
Include company names as labels
Use background color shading to indicate desirability of each quadrant

Interaction

Toggle button between radar and quadrant views
Option to select different metric combinations for the quadrant comparison
Educational tooltip explaining what each quadrant represents

Implementation Notes

For initial implementation, hardcode comparison companies from the same sector
Make the toggle between radar and quadrant views intuitive with clear labels
Include educational tooltips throughout to explain what users are seeing
Use consistent color coding between the two visualization types

User Experience Flow

User views stock card
Under "Comparative Analysis" section, radar chart displays by default
Clear button/toggle allows switching to quadrant view
Brief explanation text provides context for each visualization
Interactive elements allow exploration of the data

The quadrant comparison will be particularly valuable as it's more intuitive for beginners to understand the trade-offs between different investment characteristics. Starting with the Risk vs. Return quadrant would provide the most immediate value to users as it represents a fundamental investment concept.
